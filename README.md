# Three Omnidirectional Wheels with PID Control
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a project that involves building a mobile robot with three omnidirectional wheels that are controlled using a PID controller. The robot is designed to move in any direction without changing its orientation, making it highly maneuverable and suitable for applications such as robotics research, industrial automation, and educational projects.

# Features
- cinematic laws for the 3 wheels mouvements
- Custom hardware design with three omnidirectional wheels, motors, and encoders
= PID controller for precise speed and position control
- User-friendly control interface with joystick or keyboard

# Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine
Set up the hardware as per instructions in documentation
Compile and upload firmware to the microcontroller using appropriate toolchain
Connect joystick or keyboard to microcontroller

# Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you find a bug, have a feature request, or want to contribute to the code or documentation, please submit a pull request or open an issue on GitHub.


# Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the work of many open-source robotics communities, including ROS, Arduino, and the PID library. Special thanks to the contributors and maintainers of these projects for their valuable contributions to the field of robotics.
